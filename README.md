# ✨ KotLib ✨
Silly dependency for those paranoids that don't like having to shade ~1Mb of Kotlin libraries into their plugins. \
Could make sense if there are a lot of small plugins using kotlin in the server. \
Yes, we're those kind of paranoids.

## ⚙️ Logic
Gradle just packages the Kotlin libraries into the jar
